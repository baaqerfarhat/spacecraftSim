# 🚀 Unified PID Controller - Single File Solution

## ✅ **Perfect! One File Does Everything**

No more multiple terminals! Everything is integrated into one file with an interactive menu.

## 🎯 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Just run this ONE file:
python3 unified_pid_controller.py
```

That's it! You'll get an interactive menu to control your spacecraft.

## 🎮 **Interactive Menu**

```
🎮 SPACECRAFT CONTROL MENU
========================================
📊 Current Velocity: [0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000] m/s
📈 Velocity Magnitude: 0.0000 m/s
🎯 Controller Active: False
✅ Stopped: True

Choose an option:
1. 🚀 AUTO MOVE & PID STOP (Everything Automatic!)
2. 🎯 Manual: Start PID Control to Zero
3. 🛑 Manual: Stop PID Control
4. ⚙️  Custom Auto Move & PID Stop
5. 📊 Show Detailed Status
6. 🔧 Tune PID Gains
0. 🚪 Exit
```

## 🚀 **Recommended Usage**

1. **Start the controller:**
   ```bash
   python3 unified_pid_controller.py
   ```

2. **Choose option 1** - AUTO MOVE & PID STOP
   - **AUTOMATIC SEQUENCE:**
     1️⃣ Move forward 10% power for 1.5s
     2️⃣ Automatically engage PID control  
     3️⃣ PID drives velocity to exactly zero
     4️⃣ Perfect stop with no residual motion!
   - **You'll see real-time velocity updates during the process**
   - **Everything happens automatically - just watch!**

3. **Watch the live feedback:**
   ```
   🚀 Phase 1: MOVING FORWARD...
      Velocity: 0.1234 m/s
   ✅ Phase 1 complete - Final velocity: 0.1456 m/s
   🎯 Phase 3: ENGAGING PID CONTROL TO STOP...
   🔄 PID is now actively controlling to zero velocity...
      PID Active: Velocity = 0.0123 m/s, Error = 0.0123 m/s
   🎉 MOVEMENT COMPLETE!
   ✅ Final velocity: 0.000012 m/s
   🎯 PERFECT STOP ACHIEVED - No residual motion!
   ```

## ⚙️ **What's Built In**

- ✅ **PID Controller** - Real feedback control system
- ✅ **Velocity Feedback** - Physics simulation for testing
- ✅ **Interactive Menu** - Easy controls, no command-line complexity
- ✅ **Real-time Status** - See velocity and control state
- ✅ **PID Tuning** - Adjust gains on the fly
- ✅ **Emergency Stop** - Built-in safety

## 🔧 **Advanced Options**

### **Option 4: Custom Auto Move & PID Stop**
- Set your own power (0.0-1.0)
- Set your own duration (seconds)
- **Same automatic sequence as Option 1, but with your custom settings**
- PID automatically engages and stops the spacecraft perfectly

### **Option 6: Tune PID Gains**
- Adjust Kp (responsiveness)
- Adjust Ki (eliminates steady-state error)
- Adjust Kd (smoothness)

## 🎯 **How the Automatic PID Magic Works**

**When you choose Option 1 or 4, this ALL happens automatically:**

1. **🚀 Move Phase**: Applies forward thrust for specified time
2. **⏸️ Brief Stop**: Stops thrusters momentarily 
3. **🎯 Auto PID Engagement**: Automatically starts PID control to zero velocity
4. **🔄 Active Correction**: PID monitors actual velocity and applies corrective thrust
5. **🎉 Perfect Stop**: Drives velocity to exactly zero with no residual motion
6. **✅ Auto Complete**: System detects perfect stop and finishes automatically

**You don't need to start or stop anything manually - it's all automatic!**

## 💡 **Tips**

- **Start with option 1** to see it working
- **Low power** (0.05-0.15) works best for testing
- **Watch the velocity magnitude** drop to near zero
- **The system shows "TARGET REACHED"** when perfectly stopped

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**

- **If oscillating**: Use option 6 to reduce Kp or increase Kd
- **If slow to stop**: Increase Kp or add Ki
- **If overshooting**: Reduce Kp, increase Kd
